<INSTRUCTIONS>
This is a refine.dev MUI repository intended only for testing theme changes. Focus exclusively on updating the theme file (`src/theme.ts`) unless the user explicitly asks for additional changes.

Pull requests created by Codex must include a very detailed description, covering:
- Summary of changes
- Motivation/goal
- Design decisions and tradeoffs
- Files changed
- Testing (what was run, or why not)
- Screenshots or visual verification notes, when relevant

Always use best UI/UX practices and prioritize clarity, accessibility, and consistency in any theme-related changes.
